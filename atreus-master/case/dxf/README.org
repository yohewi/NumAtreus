* Case design files

This directory contains design files for a laser cut Atreus case.

- =case_quartered.dxf= has spacers split into 4 parts to make it
  easier to fit everything into a 24 by 12 inch sheet.
- =case.dxf= contains the same design but uses a spacer made out one piece.
- =ready-for-ponoko.svg= is the file successfully used to make an
  Atreus case using Ponoko.
- =keys.dxf= contains Cherry MX switch holes with 1x1 and 1x1.5 key
  outlines. They can be used as building blocks for new case designs.

These files are missing the logo.

Unless you're getting this cut somewhere with size restrictions, you
should probably use the =.eps= files in the parent directory. These
also only work with Cherry MX switches, not Matias or Alps.
